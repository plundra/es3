es3 - even simpler storage service
==================================

About:
The goal is to create a very minimalistic storage service, without leaving out
reliabilty; by replicating the data in a (hopefully) very simple manner.

Currently in a proof-of-concept state.

Example usage:

 Server A:
  $ mkdir /tmp/es3storage
  $ grep REPLICATION_URL config.py
  REPLICATION_URL = "http://server-b:7070/"
  $ ./main.py

 Server B:
  $ mkdir /tmp/es3storage
  $ grep REPLICATION_URL config.py
  REPLICATION_URL = "http://server-a:7070/"
  $ ./main.py

 Client (upload):
  $ curl -X PUT -T logo.png http://server-a:7070/logo.png
 
 Client (fetch):
  $ curl -O http://server-b:7070/logo.png
