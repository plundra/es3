es3 - even simpler storage service
==================================

About:
The goal is to create a very minimalistic storage service, without leaving out
reliabilty; by replicating the data in a (hopefully) very simple manner.

Current state:
Proof-of-concept with bottle.py as a webframework works fairly well. It handles
PUT-requests, GET-requests and can also list files.

Example usage:
 Server:
  $ mkdir /tmp/es3storage
  $ ./main.py

 Client (upload):
  $ curl -X PUT -T logo.png http://server:7070/logo.png
